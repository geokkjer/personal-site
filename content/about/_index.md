# Introduction

Born in Oslo, Norway in 1973. Lived in Kristiansand, Norway since 1983. 

Got my first computer in 1985, a Commodore64.

Since we did not learn about computer in school, I really got into the geekdom in the late 90's/early 00's. 
The drive back then was music production, I was active on he early internett music scene. On sites like mp3.com.
Peaked my interrest, and I installed linux way back in the late 00's. 
Moved from RedHat/Mandrake/Debian to Ubuntu then Arch(for many years) and now NixOS.
Mostly self-thought, but if I should name a teacher, it would be the legendary Arch wiki. Where we learned to read the friendly manual, as they say.
Formalised much of my knowledge with a 2-year vocational course at Noroff(Network and Security).
Also got very excited about DevOps/Kubernetes, and now it feels very natural to move closer to the code.
