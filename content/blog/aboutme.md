# Introduction

Born in Oslo, Norway in 1973. Lived in Kristiansand, Norway since 1983. 

Got my first computer in 1985, a [Commodore64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64)

Since we did not learn about computer in school, I really got into the hobby in the late 90's/early 00's. 
The drive back then was music production.
I was active on he early internett music scene. On sites like mp3.com.

This peaked my interrest in computers again, and I installed linux way back in the late 00's. 
Started with RedHat/Mandrake/Debian then moved on to Ubuntu and landed on Arch(btw) and before I discovered NixOS.

Mostly self-thought, but if I should name a teacher, it would be the legendary Arch wiki. Where we learned to read the friendly manual, as they say.

Formalised much of my knowledge with a 2-year vocational course at Noroff(Network and Security).
Also got very excited about DevOps/Kubernetes, and now it feels very natural to move closer to the code.
