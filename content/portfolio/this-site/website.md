A quick overview of of the static page generator HUGO. 


## Hugo

[Go Hugo](https://gohugo.io)

Hugo is the most well known of the static web-page generators. It has a large community, and development.

## Theme

[personal-web](https://github.com/bjacquemet/personal-web)
Starter theme for me, looking to make (it) my own. Reasonable clean, might look to strip some of it away. Maybe move to pico css.
